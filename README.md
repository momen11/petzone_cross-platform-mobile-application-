# petzone_cross-platform-mobile-application-

Today people consider pets to be a part of their family or at least best friends, but we don’t have a specific place to serve this big community of pet lovers
and give them answers about all the questions and concerns they might have, such as what things might their pet need? 
How can they travel without being able to take their pet with them? Where to go if they want to know more about their pet’s health? 
How can they find a suitable pet for them?
Unawareness of pets’ medical needs among people is also a huge problem, most new pet owners don’t know their pet’s sanitary and medical needs,
their vision of vets and service providers is distant, and they think their services are unobtainable.
We aim to bring Pet owners closer to each other, and connect them with service providers by allowing both to create accounts on the platform 
so that they can interact with one another.
